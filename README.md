<h3 align="center">ðŸš€ðŸš€An electronic engineer turned full-stack programmer ðŸš€ðŸš€

My first contact with programming was in 2013 during my technical course in electronics, where I had a semester of programming with an excellent professor who loved to prepare more challenges. I even managed to design and manipulate a skater on a matrix display that moved across the screen.

My next encounter with programming was in 2014 when I joined Ramuza Balances company. I worked there for 6 years on various projects, including creating communication with printers and back-office software, implementing filters, and other creations, improvements, and fixes.

In the 8th and 9th semesters of college, I had two programming subjects, during which I also served as a monitor:

Project of microcontrolled systems
Microprocessors and microcontrollers
In January 2021, I entered the programming world and received the opportunity to work with C programming, focusing on Point of Sale (POS) systems on Linux. In this company, I also had the opportunity to work for 6 months with ReactJS on an e-commerce website that was in the early stages of development.

In January 2022, I started at Agile Content, a company using SCRUM methodologies, working as a full-stack developer.

Currently, I work daily with NextJS on the frontend and with Microservices in NodeJS on the backend, both in ECS and Lambda environments.
